Description
===========

I wrote these scripts for downloading all Laravel documentation and storing it in 1 big html file.

After downloading you can open that html file in browser and manually copy all information from there to MS Word and save it as PDF.


Usage
-----

If you don't have 'Beautiful Soup 4' library, run one of the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-bs4
```

or

```python
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
```


After that you can run the script:

```python
python3 main.py
```

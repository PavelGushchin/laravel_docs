Description
===========

I wrote these scripts for downloading all Laravel documentation and storing it in 1 big html file.

After downloading you can open that html file in a browser and manually copy all information from there to MS Word and save it as PDF.


Usage
-----

To run this project you will need these Python packages: 'Beautiful Soup 4', 'requests' and 'lxml parser'.

If you don't have them, run the following commands:

```python
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
pip3 install requests
pip3 install lxml
```


After that you can run the script:

```python
python3 main.py
```

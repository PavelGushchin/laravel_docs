Description
===========

I wrote these scripts for downloading all Laravel documentation and storing it in 1 big html file.

After downloading you can open that html file in a browser and manually copy all information from there to MS Word and save it as PDF.


Usage
-----

If you don't have 'Beautiful Soup 4' library, run the following command:

```python
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
```


After that you can run the script:

```python
python3 main.py
```

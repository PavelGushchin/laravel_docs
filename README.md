Description
===========

I wrote these scripts for downloading all Laravel documentation and storing it in 10 html files. Each html file contains one big chapter of Laravel documentation.

After downloading you can open those html files in browser and manually copy all information from there to MS Word and save it as PDF.


Usage
-----

If you don't have 'Beautiful Soup 4' library, run one of the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-bs4
```

or

```python
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
```


And after that you can run the script:

```python
python3 main.py
```
